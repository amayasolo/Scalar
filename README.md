# Scalar, a Fridge Usage Tracker - Fall 2020 (Create X)
This project was developed during the Fall 2020 semester of Create X, where we worked on creating a product that tracks fridge item usage via an Android app and a Bluetooth-connected scale.

## Key Features
**Fridge Item Tracking:** Monitor the usage of items in your fridge using a Bluetooth-connected scale and Android app.
**UI/UX Design:** Designed and iterated on the user interface and user experience using Figma to create an intuitive and engaging app layout.
**Frontend & Backend Development:** Developed the frontend and backend using XML for layout design and Java for app logic and functionality.
**Hardware Integration:** Collaborated with computer engineers to set up the necessary infrastructure to enable software-to-hardware communication, ensuring seamless data flow between the app and Bluetooth scale.
